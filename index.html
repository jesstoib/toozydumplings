      <h2>About Toozy Dumplings</h2>
      <br></br>
      <p>Toozy Dumplings is a dumpling shop in Soho, NY founded in 2016. The founder and chef first got a taste for xiaolongbao, better known as soup dumplings in 2014 – and instantly fell in love. She went to Shanghai to learn the craft from the chef’s at the world famous Din Tai Fung. Frustrated with the fact that these dumplings are usually only made with pork, she was determined to put a twist to this delicacy. Toozy Dumplings specializes in variations of soup dumplings – vegetarian, beef, lobster, and a seasonal flavor. You can find some other Shanghainese specialties there as well. The restaurant is so popular, that they started selling frozen dumplings online, and are opening a second location in Williamsburg in 2020. Due to quality control reasons, the frozen dumplings are only being sold in the tri-state area.</p>
